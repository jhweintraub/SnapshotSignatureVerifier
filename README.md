# SnapshotSignatureVerifier

Solidity Implementations and Tests for Verifying signatures signed by participants on Snapshot.org

Snapshot.org uses the `EIP-712` standard for signing typed-messages. However, there's no solidity implementation for verifying those gasless signatures on-chain, until now.

Lots of different DAO's use different signing schemes for their voting so I'll try to keep this updated with different type systems.
